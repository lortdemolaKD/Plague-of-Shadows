# Plague of Shadows
Yeah, it's a simple game about alchemy, collecting shadows, creating potions, helping villagers, and set in the dark ages. It was a fun project and the first one I made. Despite encountering many challenges, the game is finished, though it didn't turn out exactly as I had hoped. Still, I'm satisfied with it. There's not much more to say. The game includes various mechanics and information on what to do. I just want to say, have fun and let's play more!
